    "# Data Gathering \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of my project I gathered the 3 data set that was provided in the project workspace and reading them accordingly into a dataframe using the ‘pd.read_csv’ method. As for the tweet_json.txt file, I had to read it line by line into a dataframe using the code: ‘data = []\n",

    "# Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I cleaned the data by first making a copy of all datasets and merging different tables that had the same columns (that is ‘tweet_id’ and ‘id’. Secondly, I used the define, code, and test technique to clean my data. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the issues discovered (both quality and tidiness) were cleaned in this section.\n",

    "## Identified issues \n",

    "**Missing data**: In this case, all columns with ‘NaN’ values were removed\n",

    "- Which tweet_id was most liked?\n",
    "- What dog breed had the most liked tweet within the 'p1' column?\n",
